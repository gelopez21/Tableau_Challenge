# Visualization of Citibike data with Tableau
### Aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.


Merged multiple datasets from different periods.


The following are some of the questions I tackled:

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown?
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
